## Notes!

- Consider doing other patterns such as hexagonal lattice
- Consider whether we should draw lines or just color pixels... (as in color one pixel for each step)
- Look at the examples to see what they did ^^
- try doing the golden ratio
- is this process bounded?



problems:
- displaying digits
- what happens if we run out of colors
    - could scale color spectrum to length of list
    - cyclic is an option


converting base 10 to base 4
proper scaling of the images
