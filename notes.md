## Notes!

- Consider doing other patterns such as hexagonal lattice
- Consider whether we should draw lines or just color pixels... (as in color one pixel for each step)
- Look at the examples to see what they did ^^



problems:
- displaying digits
- what happens if we run out of colors
    - could scale color spectrum to length of list
    - cyclic is an option
